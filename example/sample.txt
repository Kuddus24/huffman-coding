This is a sample text file to test the Huffman coding compression algorithm.
It contains some repeated characters and patterns to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm.
The more repeated patterns in the text, the better the compression ratio should be.
Huffman coding works by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters.
AAAAAAAA BBBB CCC DD E - This line demonstrates frequency distribution clearly.
You should see significant compression with this sample text since it has many repeated words and letters.
